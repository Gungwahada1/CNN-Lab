Hello, I'm Gungwah
Here, I want to share my project lab using Convolutional Neural Network.

if you want to use my repo, you must follow the steps to use this source code :

1.  install all library needed
2.  you can create path for your dataset in this folder create like : dataset/datasets_name/object_name.jpg
3.  run Training.py first and you get 2 file : model.h5 and labelku.lb
4.  next, run Classify.py to check our program with one image on your dataset or other image
5.  thankyou.
